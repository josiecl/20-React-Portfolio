## Description
My portfolio and contact information, remade in Reactjs. It contains 6 projects that I've worked on, along with an 'about me' section, and links to my github and linkedin. It also has ways to contact me.

## Background
I made this to demonstrate my ability to code using React. I have a portfolio very similar made using basic javascript and html, but now with React it is more optimized and better-made, as I have better learned to code since then.
